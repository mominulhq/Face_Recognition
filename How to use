How to Use main.py


With the main.py file, you can easily perform different tasks in your face recognition system by specifying the mode of operation.



python main.py --mode capture


python main.py --mode preprocess


python main.py --mode train


python main.py --mode recognize












# How to Use Each Script Individually


make sure those line uncommented at the ende of thye each file


1. capture_photos.py

This script captures photos of individuals using the webcam and saves them in a specified directory.

    Usage:
        Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions to capture multiple photos with different poses.
        The photos will be saved under data/person_name/.

    Example: python capture_photos.py



2. data_process.py

This script processes raw images by detecting faces, cropping them, and resizing them to the required dimensions.

    Usage:
        Preprocess the images captured in the data/ directory and save the processed images in processed_data/.

    Example: python data_process.py



3. train_model.py

This script is used to train a custom CNN or ResNet model on the preprocessed data.

    Usage:
        Train a model using the preprocessed images stored in processed_data/.
        The trained model and label map will be saved in the models/ directory.

    Example: python train_model.py



4. recognize_face.py

This script loads a pre-trained model and performs live face recognition using the webcam.

    Usage:
        Run the script to start live face recognition.
        Ensure that the appropriate model and label map files are specified in the script.

    Example: python recognize_face.py
